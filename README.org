* IMAP unread

This script uses Growl to inform the user about any unread messages in an IMAP
account's INBOX.  At present it doesn't allow for very much configuration, and
reads the user/password exclusively from the =~/.authinfo= file.  It can be
used as follows:

#+begin_src sh
imap-unread localhost $(whoami)
#+end_src

I use this script from the =postsynchook= in my =~/.offlineimaprc= file.
